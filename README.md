# Electric Vehicle Temperature Map <img align="right" src="Images/EVTM_LOGO.png" width="150">

The creation of a world map, or maps, of ‘EV degree days’ showing zones indicating temperature regimes of consideration for Electric Vehicle (EV) use. 

EV batteries can freeze, if left unplugged long enough, in temperatures below -20C. Battery life is lower when they are regularly subjected to high temperatures.  Range is decreased (dependent on temperature) when power must be used to heat or cool batteries or the cabin.  The product envisioned in this project would have something in common with USDA growing zone maps, showing where plants may suffer winter injury from minimum temperatures, and with engineering design temperature or heating degree day and cooling degree day information, and would allow analysis of EV range, efficiency, etc depending on location.
